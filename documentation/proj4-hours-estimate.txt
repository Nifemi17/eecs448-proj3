Project 3's total hours (60.92) ended up being pretty close to the estimate (58.55). This suggests 
that we're getting better at estimating how much time we spend on these projects, but since this is
the first time, we could have just guessed correctly. A trend of accurate estimations would be a much
better indicator. 

Still, we have been able to more accurately identify the complexity of the UFP components. Our 
"average" component did take longer to finish than most of the "simple" ones, with the exception of 
the game board with player piece. In fact, if that component had been set to "average", the estimate
would have been very close to the total hours (60.27 compared to 60.92 total).

The avg hours/FP for project 3 is 2.56. combined with project 1 (2.41) and 2 (2.51), the current 
average for the semester is approximately 2.49 hours/FP

UFP
  -inputs
    -button to shuffle letters:          3 (complexity)
	-number of players:                  3
	-player color choice:                3 
	
  -outputs
    -multiple pieces on board:           5
	-background theme/animation:         4
	-10x10 game board w/ special spaces: 5
	-Carry over unused letters:          5
	-game prep screen:                   4
	
  -Master files
    -special spaces logic:               7

  -UFP total = 9 + 23 + 7 = 39
  
DI
  -technical factors (that aren't 0)
    -end-user efficiency:         3
	-ease of operation:           2
	
  -DI total = 5
  
TCF = .65 * .05 = .7

FP = 39 * .7 = 27.3

total hours = 27.3 * 2.49 = 67.98

We predict that project 4's application will take 67.98 hours to complete. By the nature of function-point
analysis, however, this doesn't cover the time it will take to make the deployment and maintenance 
plans. Considering that each will probably take some research, we predict that project 4 in its entirety 
will take 71.98 hours to complete.
